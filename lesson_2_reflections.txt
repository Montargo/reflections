- *What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?*  
	It sets up the folder to be ready to start tracking all files that are stored in it. Because the necessary conditions to start tracking are not there to begin with.

	The staging area allows you to select which files should belong to a single commit. This ensures the commits stay logical.

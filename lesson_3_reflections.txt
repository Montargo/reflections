- *When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?*  
	- If I am  collaboration with a team
	- If it is an open source projekt
	- If I need a backup

- *Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?*
	The remote repository might have to be extra stable
